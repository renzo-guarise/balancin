# Balancin

In this project we sought to make a rocking robot or also called an inverted pendulum. To carry out this project, an accelerometer and gyroscope were used as a sensor to be able to calculate the angular position of the system and thus carry out a PID control looking for our robot to balance itself. To perform the balancing, two gear motors were used, which are controlled through a double H bridge and the entire system is controlled by an Arduino uno.

In the following image we can see a diagram of our robot.
